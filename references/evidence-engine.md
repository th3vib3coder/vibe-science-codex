# Evidence Engine

Pillar 1 of Vibe Science v4.0 — ARBOR VITAE. Transforms claims from free text into tracked, scored, verifiable assertions.

**v4.0 upgrades**: Confounder Harness (LAW 9) mandatory for every quantitative claim. New claim statuses: ARTIFACT, CONFOUNDED, ROBUST. Tree node tracking per claim.

**v5.0 IUDEX upgrades**: Confidence formula revised (hard veto + geometric mean with dynamic floor), claim.type locked by orchestrator (anti-gaming), v5.0 claim status additions (DISPUTED from circuit breaker).

## Claim Ledger

Every assertion made during research gets a ledger entry. The ledger is the single source of truth — if a claim is not in the ledger, it does not exist in the research output.

### Claim Schema

### Claim Ledger File Format (CLAIM-LEDGER.md)

```markdown
# Claim Ledger

## C-001
- **Text:** Batch correction preserves group separation in the integrated dataset
- **Type:** INFERENCE
- **Evidence:** [run-20250207/report.md Metrics], [Fig. 2A visualization], [DOI:10.xxxx/xxxxx]
- **Confidence:** 0.72
- **Status:** VERIFIED
- **Reviewer2:** ensemble-major-001
- **Depends on:** C-003 (data integrity verified), C-005 (batch key justified)
- **Assumptions:** A-002 (platform effects are batch effects)
- **Updated:** 2025-02-07

## C-002
- **Text:** Feature selection at threshold N captures domain-relevant variables
- **Type:** DATA
- **Evidence:** [feature_analysis.py output], [overlap with known markers: 87%]
- **Confidence:** 0.85
- **Status:** VERIFIED
- **Updated:** 2025-02-07
```

### Rules for Claim Extraction

1. **Atomize**: Break compound statements into single testable claims. "Method X corrects batch effects and preserves signal" → two claims.
2. **Type honestly**: If no direct data supports it, it's INFERENCE. If it's your interpretation beyond what data shows, it's OPINION. Never upgrade type.
3. **Chain dependencies**: If C-005 depends on C-003, and C-003 gets REJECTED, cascade: C-005 becomes CHALLENGED automatically.
4. **No orphan claims**: Every claim in a finding document must have a ledger entry. Every ledger entry must have evidence.

## Confidence Score: Quantitative Formula

Confidence is **computed**, not felt. v5.0 uses a hard-veto + geometric mean formula that distinguishes "no evidence" (should kill) from "not yet tested" (should penalize but not kill).

### v5.0 Formula

```
CONFIDENCE FORMULA v5.0:

Step 1: Hard veto check (LAW 1 enforcement)
  IF E < 0.05 OR D < 0.05 → confidence = 0.0
  STOP. No data = no go.

Step 2: Apply dynamic floor to soft components (unknown != false)
  R_eff = max(R_raw, floor)
  C_eff = max(C_raw, floor)
  K_eff = max(K_raw, floor)

Step 3: Aggregate
  confidence = E * D * (R_eff * C_eff * K_eff)^(1/3)

  E, D: product (hard veto — zero kills)
  R, C, K: geometric mean (softer, compensatory)
  Floor: prevents "unknown" from killing; "unknown" != "contradicted"
```

### Dynamic Floor by Claim Type and Stage

The floor varies based on the claim's epistemic type and the current research stage:

| Claim Type | Stage | Floor | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Descriptive / Correlative | Stage 1-2 (Preliminary/Hyperparameter) | 0.05 | Early exploration — "unknown" is expected |
| Descriptive / Correlative | Stage 3+ (Research Agenda onward) | 0.10 | Should have some validation by now |
| Causal / Mechanistic | Any stage | 0.15 | Stronger claims need stronger evidence |
| Paper-critical (abstract/figures) | Stage 5 (Synthesis) | 0.20 | Highest bar for publication claims |

### Anti-Gaming: claim.type is Locked

Since the floor depends on `claim.type`, a researcher could game the system by labeling a causal claim as "descriptive" to get a lower floor. Prevention:

- `claim.type` is assigned by the **orchestrator** at claim registration, based on text analysis
- Once assigned, `claim.type` is **locked** in the claim ledger
- Reclassification requires R2 review and orchestrator approval
- Schema enforces: `claim_type_assigned_by: orchestrator`, `claim_type_locked: true`

### Properties

- E=0 or D=0 → confidence = 0 (LAW 1 preserved)
- R=0 (new finding) → R_eff = floor, confidence penalized but NOT killed
- K=0 (no mechanism) → K_eff = floor, serendipitous findings protected
- All components = 1.0 → confidence = 1.0
- All soft components at floor → confidence ~ E * D * floor (heavy penalty, not death)

### R-C Collinearity Note
Replication (R) and Consistency (C) are likely correlated. The geometric mean mitigates this (less punitive than product). v6.0 may merge R and C into a single "External Validation" component.

### Backward Compatibility
Claims scored under v4.5 formula should be re-scored under v5.0 during session resume. The new formula is strictly >= the old formula (because of the floor), so no claim loses confidence.

## Assumption Register

Separate from claims. Assumptions are things we accept without proof for the purpose of this analysis.

### Assumption Schema

```markdown
| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `assumption_id` | Y | Sequential: A-001, A-002, ... |
| `text` | Y | What we assume |
| `risk` | Y | `HIGH` / `MEDIUM` / `LOW` — impact if wrong |
| `verification_plan` | Y | How we could test this assumption |
| `status` | Y | `ACTIVE` / `TESTED-OK` / `TESTED-FAIL` / `RETIRED` |
| `claims_affected` | Y | List of claim_ids that depend on this assumption |
```

### Example (ASSUMPTION-REGISTER.md)

```markdown
# Assumption Register

## A-001
- **Text:** Platform effects behave as batch effects correctable by the integration method
- **Risk:** HIGH — if platform effects are domain-specific, correction destroys real signal
- **Verification plan:** Compare results pre/post correction for known platform-independent features
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Claims affected:** C-001, C-005, C-012

## A-002
- **Text:** Raw data in the repository is truly unprocessed (not re-normalized)
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — if data is pre-normalized, preprocessing assumptions are wrong
- **Verification plan:** Check data types (int vs float), verify value ranges, check repository submission notes
- **Status:** TESTED-OK (verified correct data types in all datasets)
- **Claims affected:** C-003, C-004
```

## Evidence Mapping

When a finding document is produced, the Evidence Engine requires explicit mapping:

```markdown
## Evidence Map for Finding F-007

| Claim | Evidence Item | Type | Location |
|-------|--------------|------|----------|
| C-015 | Visualization Fig. 2A | Figure | run-20250207/figures/viz_batch.png |
| C-015 | Integration metric = 0.89 | Metric | run-20250207/report.md Table 1 |
| C-016 | Reference Table S3 | Data | 03-data/supplementary/ref_S3.csv |
| C-016 | "data suitable for..." | Quote | DOI:10.xxxx/xxxxx, p. 187 |
| C-017 | Feature overlap = 92% | Metric | run-20250207/report.md 3.2 |
```

## Confounder Harness (LAW 9 — Mandatory for Every Quantitative Claim)

**This is not optional. This is not a suggestion.** Every feature, interaction, or effect cited in any output MUST pass a three-level confounder harness before it can be cited in any output, paper, or conclusion.

### Why This Exists

The lesson from prior case studies: a claim with strong effect size and extreme statistical significance was completely confounded — propensity matching reversed the sign. Without this harness, that claim would have reached publication. The effect size was real. The statistics were correct. The narrative was plausible. But the claim was an artifact of a confounding variable.

### The Three Levels

**Level 1: Raw Estimate**
- The naive, unadjusted number
- What you get from a simple bivariate analysis
- Record: effect size, sign, magnitude, p-value, CI

**Level 2: Conditioned Estimate**
- Adjusted for known confounders via regression, stratification, or partial correlation
- Domain-specific confounders: identify the 3-5 most plausible confounders in the literature
- Record: same metrics + which confounders controlled + change from raw

**Level 3: Matched Estimate**
- Propensity-matched, exact-matched, CEM, or paired analysis on the relevant strata
- Ensures comparison groups are balanced on observed confounders
- Record: same metrics + matching method + balance check + change from raw

### Verdicts

| Observation | Verdict | Status |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Effect **changes sign** between raw and conditioned/matched | **ARTIFACT** | Killed — the effect was entirely due to confounders |
| Effect **collapses >50%** between raw and conditioned/matched | **CONFOUNDED** | Downgraded — the effect depends on confounders |
| Effect **survives all three levels** (same sign, <50% collapse) | **ROBUST** | Promotable — the effect is real after controlling |

### Claim Status Extensions (v4.0)

The claim ledger status field gains three new values:
- `ARTIFACT` — killed by confounder harness (sign reversal)
- `CONFOUNDED` — downgraded by confounder harness (>50% collapse)
- `ROBUST` — survived confounder harness (promotable)
- `DISPUTED` — frozen by circuit breaker (irreconcilable R2/researcher disagreement, see references/circuit-breaker.md)

These replace the v3.5 `VERIFIED` for quantitative claims. A quantitative claim CANNOT be `VERIFIED` without passing the confounder harness.

### Harness File

Every harness run produces a file: `CONFOUNDER-HARNESS-{claim_id}.md`
See `assets/templates.md` for the template.

### When to Run

- **MANDATORY**: Before any claim is promoted (Gate D1)
- **MANDATORY**: Before any claim appears in a conclusion (Gate D2)
- **MANDATORY**: Before R2 can clear a quantitative finding (R2 will demand it)
- **RECOMMENDED**: As early as possible — catching artifacts early saves sprints

### Domain-Specific Confounder Lists

When applying the harness, use domain-appropriate confounders. Examples by domain:

**Machine learning**: dataset size, class balance, feature dimensionality, random seed
**Observational studies**: age, sex, BMI, comorbidities, treatment history
**Time series**: seasonality, trend, autocorrelation, regime changes
**Survey/behavioral**: selection bias, response bias, social desirability, sample demographics

Identify the 3-5 most plausible confounders for YOUR specific domain from the literature.

`NO HARNESS = NO CLAIM. NO EXCEPTIONS.`

## Counter-Evidence Search (Mandatory Before Promotion)

When a claim reaches MEDIUM confidence (>= 0.60), a counter-evidence search is MANDATORY before the claim can be promoted via Gate D1.

### Protocol
1. **Search for CONTRADICTING evidence:**
   - Query databases with negation terms: "NOT [claim]", "[opposite of claim]"
   - Search for papers with contradictory findings in the same domain
   - Check if any retracted papers originally supported this claim
2. **Search for ALTERNATIVE explanations:**
   - For each causal/correlative claim: identify >=2 alternative mechanisms that could produce the same observation
   - For each alternative: assess plausibility (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
3. **Update scoring:**
   - If contradicting evidence found → reduce Concordance (C component) by 0.2 per credible contradiction
   - If plausible alternative found → flag for confounder harness (LAW 9)
   - If no contradicting evidence found after genuine search → note "counter-evidence search negative" (this STRENGTHENS the claim)
4. **Document in CLAIM-LEDGER.md:**
   - Add field: `counter_evidence_search: DONE | PENDING`
   - Add field: `contradictions_found: [list or "none after search on [databases] with [queries]"]`
   - Add field: `alternative_explanations: [list with plausibility ratings]`

### Gate D1 Integration
Gate D1 (Claim Promotion) now requires:
- `counter_evidence_search: DONE` (not PENDING)
- If contradictions found: documented and addressed (not ignored)
- If alternatives found: at least 1 tested via confounder harness

---

## Anti-Hallucination Rules (Absolute)

These rules **cannot** be relaxed under any circumstance:

1. **NEVER** present information without a source
2. **ALWAYS** include DOI or PMID for every cited paper
3. **QUOTE** exact text — do not paraphrase factual claims
4. **VERIFY** DOIs are accessible before citing (attempt web_fetch on doi.org/DOI)
5. **MARK** confidence using the quantitative formula, not intuition
6. If a claim comes from training knowledge only: `confidence: 0.0` for E component, flag explicitly
7. **CHAIN**: if claim A depends on claim B, and B is INSUFFICIENT, A inherits the constraint
8. **NO UPGRADE**: never upgrade a claim's type (DATA → OPINION is forbidden; OPINION → DATA requires new evidence)
9. **CONFOUNDER HARNESS**: every quantitative claim MUST pass the three-level harness (LAW 9) before promotion
