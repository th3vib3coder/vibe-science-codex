# Audit & Reproducibility

Pillar 4 of Vibe Science v3.5 — TERTIUM DATUR. Every decision logged, every run traceable, every comparison documented. If you cannot reproduce it, it did not happen.

## Decision Log

Append-only. Every decision with justification. Stored in `07-audit/decision-log.md`.

### Decision Entry Schema

```markdown
## DEC-YYYYMMDD-NNN

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Context:** [What prompted this decision — cycle number, gate result, review finding]
**Decision:** [What was decided]
**Justification:** [Why — evidence-based, not opinion-based]
**Alternatives considered:**
1. [Alternative A] — rejected because [reason]
2. [Alternative B] — rejected because [reason]
**Trade-offs accepted:** [What we lose by this choice]
**Reversibility:** HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
**Claims affected:** [C-xxx, C-yyy]
**Gate:** [Which gate required this decision, if any]
```

### Example

```markdown
## DEC-20250207-003

**Date:** 2025-02-07 15:30
**Context:** Gate 2 — batch key selection for integration of 12 datasets
**Decision:** Use `source_id` as batch key, with `collection_method` and `demographic_1` as categorical covariates
**Justification:**
- Variance decomposition shows source_id explains 34% of variance (largest single factor)
- Collection method explains 12% but is confounded with source_id (3 datasets use method A, 9 use method B)
- Using collection_method as covariate allows the model to account for it without conflating with source effect
**Alternatives considered:**
1. `collection_method` as batch key — rejected: only 2 levels, would under-correct for source-specific effects
2. `subject_id` as batch key — rejected: too many levels (>200), model would overfit
3. Concatenated `source_method` — rejected: creates redundant encoding, wastes parameters
**Trade-offs accepted:** Some within-source batch effects (e.g., run-level effects) will not be corrected
**Reversibility:** HIGH — can re-run with different batch key
**Claims affected:** C-001, C-005, C-012
**Gate:** G2 (Design Justification)
```

## Run Comparison

When multiple runs exist, produce a structured comparison in `07-audit/run-comparison.md`.

### Comparison Template

```markdown
# Run Comparison: [Run A] vs [Run B]

## Summary
| | Run A | Run B |
|---|---|---|
| Date | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Key change | [what changed] | [what changed] |
| Decision | [accepted/rejected] | [accepted/rejected] |

## Parameter Diff

| Parameter | Run A | Run B | delta |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| param_1 | 3000 | 5000 | +2000 |
| param_2 | 30 | 30 | 0 |
| batch_key | source_id | source_id | same |

## Metric Diff

| Metric | Run A | Run B | delta | Better? |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| metric_1 | 0.89 | 0.91 | +0.02 | yes |
| metric_2 | 0.92 | 0.88 | -0.04 | no |
| metric_3 | 0.47 | 0.44 | -0.03 | no |

## Figure Comparison
[Side-by-side visualizations, convergence plots, metric bar charts]

## Decision Motivation
Run A preferred: increasing param_1 added noise without improving mixing, and degraded separation. The small metric_1 improvement (+0.02) does not justify the metric_2 loss (-0.04).

## Claims Affected
- C-002 (feature selection captures domain variables): CONFIRMED by this comparison
```

## Run Manifest

Every run MUST produce a `manifest.json`. The manifest enables:

1. **Exact reproduction**: Same parameters + same seeds + same versions → same output
2. **Provenance chain**: Input hash → processing → output hash
3. **Comparison**: Diff two manifests to see exactly what changed

### Manifest Validation Checklist

```
[] All parameters recorded (no implicit defaults — everything explicit)
[] Random seeds listed (minimum 2 for stochastic methods)
[] Package versions exact (not ranges, not "latest")
[] Input file checksums present (SHA-256)
[] Output file checksums present (SHA-256)
[] Gates passed listed
[] Decision recorded (accepted/rejected + reason)
[] Previous run referenced (if applicable)
```

## Snapshot Protocol

At key milestones, create a snapshot of the entire .vibe-science/ state:

### When to Snapshot

- Before a serendipity pivot
- Before a major architectural change
- After final Reviewer Ensemble approval
- Before concluding an RQ (positive or negative)

### Snapshot Contents

```
snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD-[reason]/
|-- STATE.md                    (copy)
|-- CLAIM-LEDGER.md             (copy)
|-- ASSUMPTION-REGISTER.md      (copy)
|-- PROGRESS.md                 (last 50 lines)
|-- latest-run/manifest.json    (copy)
+-- SNAPSHOT-NOTE.md            (why this snapshot was taken)
```

## Diff Thinking

To save tokens and time, apply diff thinking:

1. **Before each cycle**: What changed since last cycle? Only process the delta.
2. **Claim ledger updates**: Only re-score claims whose evidence changed.
3. **Run comparisons**: Only highlight parameters and metrics that differ.
4. **Search deduplication**: Before running a query, check queries.log. If already run with <=7 day staleness, skip.
5. **Finding deduplication**: Before creating a finding doc, check FINDINGS.md. If substantially similar finding exists, update instead of creating new.

### Dedup Protocol for Sources

```markdown
## Source Dedup Check

Before adding a source:
1. Check if DOI already appears in CLAIM-LEDGER.md or any finding doc
2. If yes: reference existing entry, do not re-extract
3. If no: extract and add as new source
4. Maintain a source registry:

| DOI | First seen | Referenced by | Last checked |
|-----|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 10.xxxx/xxx | 2025-02-07 | C-001, C-005 | 2025-02-07 |
```

## Triage Classification

Not everything is equally important. Classify issues before investing effort:

| Priority | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **P0 — Critical** | Invalidates current conclusions. Data integrity issue. Gate-blocking. | Fix immediately. Stop all other work. |
| **P1 — Major** | Significantly affects quality. Weakens claims. Missing required evidence. | Fix before next cycle. Log in decision-log. |
| **P2 — Minor** | Cosmetic. Additional supporting evidence. Nice-to-have ablation. | Queue for batch processing. Do not block progress. |
| **P3 — Deferred** | Future improvement. Optimization. Alternative approach to try later. | Log in PROGRESS.md. Address in future RQ or session. |

## Reproducibility Contract

A research output is reproducible if and only if:

1. **All inputs** are specified with checksums
2. **All parameters** are explicit (no implicit defaults)
3. **All seeds** are recorded
4. **All versions** are pinned
5. **All decisions** are logged with justification
6. **All gates** are documented with pass/fail evidence
7. **All claims** are in the ledger with computed confidence
8. **All assumptions** are registered with risk and verification plan
9. **All artifacts** exist as files (not just prose descriptions)
10. **A fresh execution** from the manifest would produce equivalent results (stochastic methods: within seed-replicate variance)
