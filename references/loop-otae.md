# OTAE-Tree Loop — Detailed Protocol

> Load this when: first cycle of a session, or when the loop needs re-grounding.

## Overview

OTAE = Observe → Think → Act → Evaluate → Checkpoint → Crystallize. Adapted from OpenAI Codex agent loop for scientific research.

v3.5 had a flat OTAE loop: cycle 1 → cycle 2 → cycle 3 → ...

v4.0 has a **tree of OTAE nodes**:

```
                     root
                    /    \
                node-A   node-B        ← each is a full OTAE cycle
               / |  \      |
            A1  A2  A3    B1           ← children = variations
           /
         A1a                           ← deeper exploration
```

Each node executes one complete OTAE cycle (Observe parent → Think plan → Act execute → Evaluate score). The tree search engine selects which node to expand next based on Evidence Engine confidence + metrics.

**When to branch vs. stay linear:**
- Literature review → LINEAR (sequential cycles, like v3.5)
- Computational experiments → BRANCHING (tree search over variants)
- Mixed research → HYBRID (linear discovery phase, then branch for experiments)

Each cycle produces ONE meaningful action. No multi-step bundles. One action, verified, documented, then next cycle.

## OBSERVE Phase

### What to Read
1. `STATE.md` — entire file (max 100 lines)
2. `TREE-STATE.json` — current tree structure, current node, best node
3. `PROGRESS.md` — last 20 lines
4. Check: `minor_findings_pending` count in STATE.md frontmatter
5. Check: `cycle` number (warn at 15, force review at 20)
6. Identify current stage (1-5) from STATE.md frontmatter
7. [v5.5] Check Observer alerts. Check SPINE.md last entry.

### Load Node Context
- Read current node from TREE-STATE.json (`current_node` field)
- Read parent chain: current → parent → ... → root
- Load parent node's `evaluate_result` and `metrics` (this is the starting point for THINK)
- Check: is current node pending, running, good, buggy, pruned?

### Consistency Check
- Does STATE.md's "Current Tree State" match TREE-STATE.json?
- Does STATE.md's "Next Action" match what PROGRESS.md last recorded?
- If STATE <-> TREE mismatch → TREE-STATE.json is authoritative (it's the structured format)
- If STATE <-> PROGRESS mismatch → something was interrupted. Resume from PROGRESS.md (it's append-only, more reliable).
- If STATE.md is corrupt or >100 lines → rewrite from PROGRESS.md last 5 entries + TREE-STATE.json.

### Context Assembly
After reading, you should know:
- Current RQ, phase, stage, and tree mode
- Current node and its parent chain
- Best node and its metrics
- What was last done
- What needs doing next
- Any pending R2 demands or gate failures
- Any pending serendipity flags

## THINK Phase

### Mode-Dependent Decision

**TREE MODE (branching/hybrid computational phases):**

1. Is there a pending R2 verdict I need to address? → Address it first (blocking)
2. Is there a gate failure I need to fix? → Fix it first (blocking)
3. [v5.5] DD0: Document all columns/fields in the dataset before use. Column names can be misleading — verify semantics.
4. [v5.5] L-1: Literature pre-check before committing to a new direction node. Search for prior art to confirm the direction is novel.
5. **Node Selection (Best-First):**
   - If pending debug nodes exist AND random() < 0.5: → Select oldest pending debug node
   - If current stage demands specific type (e.g. Stage 2 = hyperparameter): → Select best unexpanded node of that type
   - Otherwise: → Select node with highest score across all branches
   - Score = evidence_confidence * 0.6 + metric_improvement * 0.3 + novelty * 0.1
6. **Node Type Selection:**
   - Stage 1: `draft` (new approaches)
   - Stage 2: `hyperparameter` or `improve`
   - Stage 3: `draft` (creative variants)
   - Stage 4: `ablation` or `replication`
   - Any stage: `debug` (if parent is buggy, max 3 attempts)
   - Any stage: `serendipity` (if score >= 12)
7. What would falsify the parent node's result? (mandatory question)
8. Plan the specific action for this node

**LINEAR MODE (literature/discovery phases):**

Same as v3.5 — ask these questions IN ORDER:
1. Is there a pending R2 verdict I need to address? → Address it first (blocking)
2. Is there a gate failure I need to fix? → Fix it first (blocking)
3. [v5.5] DD0: Document all columns/fields in the dataset before use.
4. [v5.5] L-1: Literature pre-check before committing to a new direction.
5. What is the highest-priority open question for this RQ?
6. What single action would most advance toward answering it?
7. What tool/skill do I need to execute this action?

### Decision Types

| Type | Description | Dispatch |
|------|-------------|----------|
| SEARCH | Need more literature evidence | search-protocol.md |
| EXTRACT | Have a paper, need to pull specific data | data-extraction.md |
| VALIDATE | Have a claim, need to verify numerically | analysis pipeline |
| COMPUTE | Need to run analysis pipeline | analysis pipeline |
| TREE_EXPAND | Expand tree with new node (computational) | auto-experiment.md |
| BRAINSTORM | Phase 0 hypothesis generation | brainstorm-engine.md |
| SERENDIPITY_TRIAGE | Serendipity flag needs investigation | serendipity-engine.md |
| REVIEW | Need to invoke R2 (trigger reached) | reviewer2-ensemble.md |
| PIVOT | Research direction change | requires user approval |
| EXIT | Stop conditions met | → CRYSTALLIZE final state |

### Log the Decision
Before acting, write to PROGRESS.md:
```
### Cycle N — HH:MM [Stage S, Node node-xxx]
- **DECIDE:** [ACTION TYPE]: [specific plan] because [rationale]
```

### Gate T0 Check
Before expanding a new tree node, verify Gate T0 (Node Validity):
- Node has valid type for current stage
- Node has valid parent (exists in TREE-STATE.json, not pruned)
- Node has non-empty action plan (think_plan)
- Gate T0 FAIL → fix type/parent/plan before proceeding

---

## ACT Phase

### Execution Rules
1. ONE action per cycle. Not two. One.
2. Use the appropriate tool/skill (dispatch via skill-router.md if needed)
3. Produce ARTIFACTS — files, not prose. If you can save it as a file, do so.
4. Track exact inputs and outputs
5. If action produces code: save to `08-tree/nodes/{node_id}/` directory
6. [v5.5] DQ1 after feature extraction: verify extracted features match expectations.
7. [v5.5] DQ2 after model training: verify training convergence and diagnostics.
8. [v5.5] DQ3 after calibration: verify calibration metrics are within acceptable bounds.

### Action-Specific Protocols

| Action | Load | Do |
|--------|------|----|
| SEARCH | search-protocol.md | Query database, record in queries.log |
| EXTRACT | data-extraction.md | Download supplementary, parse tables |
| VALIDATE | analysis pipeline | Run validation, check statistical significance |
| COMPUTE | analysis pipeline | Execute pipeline step |
| TREE_EXPAND | auto-experiment.md | Generate code, execute, parse metrics |
| BRAINSTORM | brainstorm-engine.md | Gap analysis, hypothesis generation |
| SERENDIPITY_TRIAGE | serendipity-engine.md | Score, investigate, decide: NOISE/FILE/QUEUE/INTERRUPT |
| REVIEW | reviewer2-ensemble.md | Invoke R2 adversarial protocol |

### Debug Protocol (tree mode)
If the node's execution fails (buggy):
1. Mark node as `buggy` in TREE-STATE.json
2. Create a `debug` child node
3. Check Gate T1: debug_attempts <= 3 for the buggy parent
4. If T1 PASS → attempt fix with a DIFFERENT root cause approach
5. If T1 FAIL (>3 attempts) → PRUNE the node. Mark as `pruned` with reason. Move on. Do NOT attempt a 4th fix.
6. Each debug attempt MUST address a different root cause (not repeating the same fix)

---

## EVALUATE Phase

### For Every Result

1. **Source check**: Does it have DOI/PMID/dataset_id?
2. **Accessibility check**: Can the data actually be accessed?
3. **Consistency check**: Does it match or contradict existing findings?
4. **Claim extraction**: What new claims emerge from this result? → CLAIM-LEDGER.md
5. **Confidence scoring**: Apply formula (see evidence-engine.md) — computed, NOT felt
6. **Assumption check**: Did any assumption change? → ASSUMPTION-REGISTER.md
7. **Metric parsing** (if computational node): Extract metrics, compute delta from parent
8. **VLM feedback** (if figures generated and VLM available): Apply Gate G6
9. [v5.5] DQ4: Verify that numbers in FINDINGS.md match their JSON/data source exactly. No manual transcription errors.
10. [v5.5] R2 INLINE 7-point checklist per finding — every finding passes R2 inline review before being recorded in CLAIM-LEDGER.

### Serendipity Radar (EVERY cycle, BEFORE gates)

Run the full 5-scan protocol (see serendipity-engine.md):

1. **ANOMALY SCAN**: Does this node's result contradict its parent's pattern? Is a metric moving in unexpected direction? Unexpected side-output?
2. **CROSS-BRANCH SCAN** (tree mode only): Compare with sibling branches. Pattern visible only when comparing? Two branches failing for different reasons suggesting a third approach?
3. **CONTRADICTION SCAN**: Contradicts any claim in CLAIM-LEDGER? Contradicts published finding in knowledge base?
4. **CONNECTION SCAN**: Connects to a different RQ? Echoes a pattern from a different domain? Unexpected similarity to an unrelated paper?
5. **SCORE** (0-15): Data availability (0-3) + Potential impact (0-3) + Connection strength (0-3) + Novelty (0-3) + Feasibility (0-3)

Response: 0-3 NOISE → log and move on | 4-7 FILE → log with details | 8-11 QUEUE → create tagged entry for Serendipity Sprint | 12-15 INTERRUPT → STOP, create serendipity node, triage immediately

### Gate Application

Apply ALL relevant gates for the action type:

**Pipeline Gates (data/compute actions):**
- G0: Data loaded correctly? (correct types, no NaN/Inf)
- G1: Schema normalized?
- G2: Design justified? (key parameters, covariates)
- G3: Training converged? (loss diagnostics, no train-val gap)
- G4: Metrics meaningful? (contextualized, trade-offs explicit)
- G5: Artifacts complete? (manifest, report, figures, metrics)
- G6: VLM validation? (if VLM available — OPTIONAL)

**Literature Gates (search/extract actions):**
- L0: Source validity (DOIs verified, no training-knowledge claims as DATA)
- L1: Coverage adequacy (2+ databases, 3+ strategies, negative results documented)
- L2: Review completeness (all findings reviewed, counter-evidence searched)

**Tree Gates (tree mode):**
- T0: Node validity (valid type, valid parent, non-empty plan)
- T1: Debug limit (<=3 attempts per buggy node)
- T2: Branch diversity (siblings differ substantively)

Gate FAIL → stop, fix, re-gate. Do NOT continue past a failed gate.

### Node Status Update (tree mode)
After evaluation:
- Result valid + metrics computed → mark node `good`
- Execution failed or produced errors → mark node `buggy`
- Already `buggy` and T1 fails → mark node `pruned`
- Best in tree → candidate for `promoted` (after R2 clearance)

---

## CHECKPOINT Phase

### Stage Gate Check (S1-S5)
At the end of each node evaluation, check if the current stage gate is satisfied:
- S1: At least 1 good node with valid metrics + multi-seed validation
- S2: Best metric improved over Stage 1 + tested on 2+ configs + 1 ablation
- S3: All planned sub-experiments attempted + results documented
- S4: All key components ablated + multi-seed (3+ seeds) + cross-validation + confounder harness for all promoted claims
- S5: R2 full ensemble ACCEPT + Gate D2 PASS + all claims verified + all harnesses completed

If stage gate PASS → advance stage, R2 batch review at transition (BLOCKING), set best node as root for next stage.
If stage gate FAIL → remain in stage, address failure, re-check.

[v5.5] DC0: Design compliance check at stage transitions. Before advancing to the next stage, verify that the current execution matches the original design intent. If drift is detected, document it and get R2 sign-off.

### Tree Health Check (T3)
Every 5 cycles, or after any node is pruned:
- good_nodes / total_nodes >= 0.2? (at least 20% productive)
- No branch with 5+ consecutive non-improving nodes?
- At least 2 branches explored (unless tree_mode = LINEAR)?

T3 FAIL → STOP expanding. R2 emergency review. Strategy revision. Do NOT add more nodes.

### R2 Co-Pilot Check

| Trigger | Mode | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| Major finding this cycle | FORCED | Full ensemble review (BLOCKING) |
| Stage transition | FORCED | Full ensemble review (BLOCKING) |
| Confidence explosion (>0.30 in 2 cycles) | FORCED | Confirmation bias check (BLOCKING) |
| Pivot decision | FORCED | Full ensemble review (BLOCKING) |
| minor_findings_pending >= 3 | BATCH | Single-pass batch review (BLOCKING) |
| Every 3 cycles automatically | SHADOW | Passive review — see Shadow Protocol |
| R2 spots fatal flaw during any mode | VETO | Halts branch or entire tree (BLOCKING, cannot override except by human) |
| R2 identifies better direction | REDIRECT | Proposes alternative (soft — user chooses) |
| cycle >= 20 | FORCED | Comprehensive review of ALL findings |

**R2 Shadow Protocol (every 3 cycles):**
1. Read CLAIM-LEDGER.md — any confidence scores drifting up without new evidence?
2. Read ASSUMPTION-REGISTER.md — any HIGH-risk assumptions untested for 5+ cycles?
3. Read tree-visualization.md — is the tree lopsided? (one branch getting all attention)
4. Read SERENDIPITY.md — any flags ignored for 3+ cycles?
5. Compute: assumption_staleness, confidence_drift, tree_balance, serendipity_neglect
6. If ANY metric is concerning → log warning in PROGRESS.md
7. If 2+ metrics concerning → ESCALATE to FORCED R2 review

If R2 is triggered → load `references/reviewer2-ensemble.md` and execute. R2 is BLOCKING — demands must be addressed before continuing.

### Serendipity Sprint Check
- Every 10 cycles: dedicate 1 cycle to reviewing all QUEUEd serendipity entries
- Every 5 cycles in BRANCHING mode: scan ALL branches for cross-branch patterns
- If 3+ entries in QUEUE without review → forced sprint next cycle

### Stop Condition Check
After all checks:
- SUCCESS? All success criteria met + R2 cleared + S5 PASS → EXIT
- NEGATIVE? Hypothesis disproven by evidence → EXIT (still valuable — document)
- SERENDIPITY? Unexpected discovery confirmed → Create new RQ or extend current
- DIMINISHING RETURNS? cycle > 15, low finding rate → WARN user
- INFINITE LOOP? cycle > 30 AND no new findings in last 5 cycles → STOP, force R2 comprehensive, present options to user
- CONTINUE? → proceed to CRYSTALLIZE, then LOOP BACK TO OBSERVE

---

## CRYSTALLIZE Phase (LAW 10: NOT IN FILE = DOESN'T EXIST)

This is not optional. Every result of every cycle MUST be saved to disk. Context windows are ephemeral — files are permanent. If it's not in a file, it will be lost on the next compaction.

### Always Update (in this order)

1. **CLAIM-LEDGER.md** — add new claims, update existing statuses, record confounder harness results
2. **ASSUMPTION-REGISTER.md** — add/update any assumptions, increment cycles_untested counter
3. **TREE-STATE.json** — update node status, metrics, children, tree health counters
4. **Node file** in `08-tree/nodes/{node_id}.md` — full OTAE content for this node
5. **tree-visualization.md** in `08-tree/` — ASCII tree with current state
6. **PROGRESS.md** — append cycle summary (format from templates.md)
7. **STATE.md** — rewrite with current state (max 100 lines)
8. **Save intermediate data** — CSVs, metrics JSON, figures, scripts → appropriate directories
9. **Log decisions** — any decisions made this cycle → decision-log.md with DEC-YYYYMMDD-NNN format
10. [v5.5] Mandatory SPINE.md entry for this cycle. Write a structured logbook entry documenting what was done, what was found, and what comes next. Not optional, not retroactive.
11. [v5.5] SSOT sync check: verify that FINDINGS.md, CLAIM-LEDGER.md, and all JSON data sources are consistent. Flag any desynchronization.

### Verification
After writing all files, verify:
- Every ACT result exists as a file on disk (not just in the context window)
- TREE-STATE.json is valid JSON and consistent with STATE.md
- No claims exist only in prose — all are in CLAIM-LEDGER.md
- No serendipity observations exist only in context — all are in SERENDIPITY.md

### Then
→ LOOP BACK TO OBSERVE

---

## Cycle Timing

Each cycle should produce exactly ONE meaningful action. If a cycle is producing multiple actions or loading many files, it's doing too much. Break it into multiple cycles.

---

## Emergency Protocols

### Context Rot Detected
If you notice you're repeating yourself or contradicting earlier work:
1. STOP immediately
2. Read PROGRESS.md from the beginning (or last 50 lines)
3. Read CLAIM-LEDGER.md
4. Read TREE-STATE.json
5. Rewrite STATE.md from scratch based on these files
6. Resume

### State File Corruption
If STATE.md is missing or corrupt:
1. Check TREE-STATE.json (structured, most reliable for tree state)
2. Check PROGRESS.md (append-only, most reliable for chronology)
3. Reconstruct STATE.md from these two sources
4. Continue from there

### Tree State Corruption
If TREE-STATE.json is missing or corrupt:
1. Check `08-tree/nodes/` directory — individual node files are the ground truth
2. Check PROGRESS.md for node creation/update entries
3. Reconstruct TREE-STATE.json from node files + PROGRESS.md
4. Verify with STATE.md
5. Re-run Gate T3 (tree health)

### Infinite Loop Detection
If cycle > 30 AND no new findings in last 5 cycles:
1. STOP
2. Force R2 comprehensive review of ALL findings
3. Check tree health — is the tree stuck in one unproductive branch?
4. Present options to user: conclude, pivot, prune and restart, or new approach
