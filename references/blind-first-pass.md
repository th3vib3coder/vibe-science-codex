# Blind-First Pass Protocol

Anti-anchoring barrier for R2 Ensemble reviews. Forces independent assessment before exposure to the researcher's framing, methodology, or confidence computation.

**v5.0 addition**: Two-phase review within a single R2 invocation, CoVe verification questions, self-consistency N=3, mandatory discrepancy accounting. Integrates with R3 Independence scoring.

**When**: Every FORCED R2 review. Not BATCH, not SHADOW, not BRAINSTORM.

> **Note (v5.5):** In Codex multi-agent mode, BFP is native: the R2 sub-agent has a separate context and never sees the researcher's reasoning. The two-phase protocol described below applies to single-agent (SOLO) mode where R2 is a persona within the same context. In multi-agent mode, Phase 1 is structurally guaranteed by context isolation — the R2 agent literally cannot see the researcher's justifications until they are explicitly passed. Phase 2 still applies: the R2 agent receives full context and must reconcile with its independent assessment.

## Phase 1 -- BLIND ASSESSMENT

R2 receives ONLY the following for each claim under review:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `claim_id` | Claim identifier from CLAIM-LEDGER.md |
| `claim_text` | Exact text of the assertion |
| `claim_type` | `descriptive` / `correlative` / `causal` / `predictive` |
| `evidence_location` | File paths or DOIs -- NOT the interpretation |

R2 does NOT receive: researcher's methodology description, confidence computation (E, R, C, K, D), counter-evidence search results, confounder harness results, or any researcher commentary.

### Phase 1 Required Output

For each claim, R2 MUST produce:

1. **Evidence needed**: What specific evidence would I need to see to believe this claim?
2. **Alternative explanations**: The 3 most likely alternative explanations for the observed result.
3. **Falsification test**: One specific test that would falsify this claim if it fails.
4. **Confounders**: What confounders should I check before accepting this?
5. **Independent assessment**: `SUSPICIOUS` | `PLAUSIBLE` | `STRONG`

### CoVe Verification Questions (Phase 1 extension)

For each claim, R2 MUST also generate verification questions independent of the draft:

- What would need to be true in the data for this claim to hold?
- What database or source would contain counter-evidence?
- What statistical test or diagnostic would detect an artifact here?

These questions are answered in Phase 2. They create a structured anti-anchoring barrier: R2 commits to what it needs to see BEFORE seeing the researcher's answer.

---

## Phase 2 -- FULL REVIEW

R2 additionally receives:

- Researcher's methodology description
- Confidence computation (E, R, C, K, D components)
- Counter-evidence search results
- Confounder harness results (if available)

### Phase 2 Required Actions

1. **Answer CoVe questions**: Using the full context, answer every verification question generated in Phase 1.
2. **Compare assessments**: For each claim, compare the Phase 1 blind assessment with the Phase 2 evidence.
3. **Flag gaps**: Flag any claim where Phase 2 evidence does NOT address Phase 1 concerns.
4. **Produce final report**: Standard R2 ensemble report (existing YAML schema from `reviewer2-ensemble.md`).
5. **Record discrepancies**: Add `blind_assessment_comparison` section to the output.

---

## Discrepancy Accounting (mandatory)

Every Phase 1 concern that changes or disappears in Phase 2 MUST be explained. Append to the ensemble report:

```yaml
blind_assessment_comparison:
  - claim_id: C-xxx
    phase1_assessment: SUSPICIOUS | PLAUSIBLE | STRONG
    phase2_assessment: PASS | WEAK | FAIL
    phase1_concerns: ["concern A", "concern B"]
    concerns_addressed: ["concern A — addressed by confounder harness"]
    concerns_unaddressed: ["concern B — not addressed, remains open"]
    discrepancy_explanation: "Phase 1 flagged X; Phase 2 showed Y resolved it because Z"
```

Rule: If a Phase 1 concern disappears in Phase 2 without the evidence explicitly addressing it, this is anchoring bias. R2 MUST retain the concern, and R3 MUST lower the Independence score.

---

## Self-Consistency Enhancement

For FORCED reviews on high-risk claims (confidence >= 0.60):

1. R2 generates **N=3 independent Phase 1 assessments** using different sampling (temperature variance).
2. Each assessment produces its own evidence-needed list, alternatives, and verdict.
3. The **most conservative** verdict wins (not majority vote). Ordering: `SUSPICIOUS` > `PLAUSIBLE` > `STRONG`.
4. All three assessments are logged; the final Phase 1 output uses the most conservative.

This creates divergence within a single context. Self-consistency at equal compute cost provides independent assessment diversity (Wang et al., arXiv:2203.11171).

---

## Integration with R3 (Judge Agent)

The R3 rubric scores an **Independence** dimension. BFP provides structural evidence:

- R3 reads the `blind_assessment_comparison` section from the ensemble report.
- If Phase 1 concerns vanish in Phase 2 without being addressed: Independence score drops (score 0-1 on that dimension).
- If Phase 1 concerns are retained or explicitly resolved: Independence score holds (score 2-3).
- R3 also checks whether self-consistency N=3 was performed for high-risk claims. If skipped, Independence score cannot exceed 1.
